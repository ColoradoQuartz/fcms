# What is it?
Family Connections is a private social networking site for families or small groups of people.

# Why?
Because social networking sites like Facebook/Google+ are not private enough for family use. Family Connections allows you more control over your site: from who can access it, to what it looks like and what features it has.

# Installation

1. Upload the familyconnections/ directory in FCMS_3.3.1.zip to your web host.

2. Run the online installation script by visiting your website.

     http://www.yourdomain.com/path/to/install.php

3. It is recommended that you delete the install.php file after installation.
